# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Render Deployment

## Description

This project demonstrates a basic **CI/CD pipeline** setup using **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and deployment for a full-stack application.

- When a **pull request** is made to the `develop` branch, **Cypress component tests** are automatically run.
- When changes are merged into the `main` branch, the application is automatically **deployed to Render** using a deploy hook.

## Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions
- Cypress (for component testing)
- Render (for deployment)
- Node.js / Express / MongoDB (application stack)
